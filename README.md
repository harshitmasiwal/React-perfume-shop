The Perfume Co.
Welcome to The Perfume Co., an e-commerce platform for perfumes! This project is built using React for the frontend and Node.js with MongoDB for the backend. The website is styled using Tailwind CSS.

Getting Started
To run this project locally, follow the steps below for both the frontend and backend.

Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd the-perfume-co

Step 2: Set up the Backend
Navigate to the backend directory:
cd backend

Install the necessary dependencies:
npm install
Before starting the server, run the seed.js file to populate the database with initial data:
node seed.js

Start the backend server:
npm start
The backend should now be running on http://localhost:5000 (or whichever port is configured).

Step 3: Set up the Frontend
Navigate to the frontend directory:
cd ../frontend

Install the required dependencies
npm install


Start the frontend development server:
npm start
The frontend should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues with the backend, ensure that your MongoDB server is running and that the MONGODB_URI in the .env file is correctly configured.
If the frontend does not load correctly, check that the backend is running and reachable.
