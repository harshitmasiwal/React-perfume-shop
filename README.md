cd the-perfume-co

Step 2: Set up the Backend
Navigate to the backend directory:
cd backend

Install the necessary dependencies:
npm install
Before starting the server, run the seed.js file to populate the database with initial data:
node seed.js

Start the backend server:
npm start
The backend should now be running on http://localhost:5000 (or whichever port is configured).

Step 3: Set up the Frontend

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues with the backend, ensure that your MongoDB server is running and that the MONGODB_URI in the .env file is correctly configured.
If the frontend does not load correctly, check that the backend is running and reachable.
